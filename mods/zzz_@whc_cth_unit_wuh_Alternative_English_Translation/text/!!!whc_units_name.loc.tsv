unit_description_historical_texts_text_cth_cav_guanning_firelancer	The massive trade ports of the Eastern Provinces facilitate the flow of imported and exported firearms, significantly influencing the tactical style of the stationed forces. Before Nan-Gau became Cathay's industrial powerhouse, traditional firearms from regions like Fu-Chow and Beichai played pivotal roles in battles across Cathay. Even now, firepower-focused tactics dominate the strategic thinking of the Eastern border armies and naval forces.\\n\\nFirelances combine firearms and polearms. Each barrel fires sequentially, sacrificing precision for explosive impact. After firing, the heated barrels double as deadly melee weapons. Before modern Iron Hail Guns became standard in Cathay's arsenal, these quad-barreled firelances were widely used and are now a secret weapon of elite shock cavalry.	false

unit_description_short_texts_text_wh3_main_unit_short_text_cth_cav_bayara	Elite riders of the Vanguard Battalion, tasked with breaking enemy lines; they lead the charge and guard the flanks.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_cth_cav_bayara	Before Cathay's unification, northern nomadic tribes posed a grave threat to the central plains, and their heavy cavalry were a nightmare for Cathayan soldiers. These elite horsemen, called Bayara, meaning "Vanguard Warriors", were clad in cloth-covered iron armor from head to horse, offering superior ranged defense and significantly reduced weight. This made them ideal for raids and using mobility to weaken the enemy. Today, under the Dragon Emperor's command, former enemies now stand united against the forces of destruction beyond the Jade Sea, protecting Cathay's eternal peace together.	false

unit_description_short_texts_text_wh3_main_unit_short_text_cth_inf_great_bastion_sentinels	The Sentinels of the Dragon Spine are the elite defenders of Cathay's northern borders. Only when they all fall will the Bastion face a true threat.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_cth_inf_great_bastion_sentinels	The Great Bastion, also known as the Dragon Spine, is an indomitable fortress constructed by the Dragon Emperor himself. Stretching across Cathay's northern frontier, this wall spans multiple provinces and has stood as the first line of defense against Chaos incursions for centuries. This marvel of engineering is upheld by countless bricks and thousands of fearless defenders. While Jade Warrior units rotate along the Bastion, the Sentinels of the Dragon Spine are its permanent guardians. Equipped with spiked shields and maces, they are experts in holding the line.\\n\\nFor both material support and emotional solace, their families reside near the Bastion. Despite harsh conditions and relentless Chaos threats, these steadfast defenders protect all they hold dear within the Bastion.	false
land_units_onscreen_name_cth_inf_beiweijun	Beichai Heavy Guard	false
unit_description_short_texts_text_wh3_main_unit_short_text_cth_inf_beiweijun	Beichai warriors are heavily armed, highly motivated, and wield massive axes capable of cleaving through armor, making them a nightmare for armored cavalry.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_cth_inf_beiweijun	In Cathay's early days, conventional weapons focused on agility and thrusting, excelling in coordinated troop movements. However, the growing threat of Chaos tribes increased the need for armor-piercing heavy weaponry. Such weapons required extraordinary physical strength and willpower. Warriors chosen from various legions for these traits formed the Beichai Army, equipped with heavy axes and subjected to rigorous training.\\n\\nOn the battlefield, the Beichai Army fights with tight coordination and unmatched courage. Against cavalry, they swing their axes to sever horse legs, then cleave the helmets of fallen riders. The sight of these battle-hardened warriors inspires nearby Cathayan troops, bolstering their morale and offensive strength. It is time to march north and strike back.	false
