unit_description_historical_texts_text_YLlyxw	The Dragonfang Bloodguard are known for their long sword-lances, black and silver armor, and blood-red cloaks. They are the most elite warriors under Yinglong's command, his sharpest claws and teeth, and the enemy's worst nightmare. Countless Chaos armies have fallen before this elite force. Every Dragonfang Bloodguard is a warrior tempered in mountains of corpses and seas of blood, and their lifelong pursuit is to follow Yinglong in conquering all invaders.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_YL_pjcw	Founded by Master Gongshu Ye, the Nan-Gau Celestial Foundry produces weapons and armor far superior to those of ordinary forges. The Vanguard Musket Guard's equipment is Master Gongshu Ye's proudest creation. To craft this new set of equipment, Gongshu Ye harnessed the heavenly fire of Nan-Gau's volcano as his forge and used meteoric iron as the primary material. After expending tremendous effort, he finally completed the Dragonfire Musket and Vanguard Armor, fulfilling his promise to Yinglong. The sound of the Vanguard Musket Guard's muskets has become the most chilling sound outside the Great Bastion.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_YL_lycs	Although the Thunderfire Gunners' Thunderfire Muskets are replicas of the Dragonfire Muskets and use less rare materials for mass production, they still have their unique advantages.

unit_description_historical_texts_text_YL_xtw	The Xing Tian Guard is composed of Ogres bestowed with the Blood of Xing Tian. Many of them fight against Chaos north of the Great Bastion in exchange for delicious food and generous rewards from Grand Cathay. After witnessing Xing Tian's heroic combat prowess, they were deeply impressed and gradually gathered around him. Xing Tian shared his power with them, and thus the Xing Tian Guard gradually took shape.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_YL_yhcf	Although the Inferno Chaofeng was inspired by the Chaos Dwarfs' war beasts, it has been improved by Master Gongshu Ye of the Celestial Foundry, discarding the evil design of imprisoning daemons as a power source. The Celestial Foundry, in collaboration with the Jade Court Astronomer Royal, sought the spirit power from the Soul-Dragon, who bestowed the spirit of Chaofeng upon the beast. With this as its core, this war beast not only possesses the might to trample any battlefield but also has the power to dispel evil and purify for its allies.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_YL_cgs	Many members of the Spearman unit are farmers who engage in military training during their free time. They are trained by retired Jade Warrior soldiers, focusing on self-defense and delaying the enemy's advance.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_YL_zsyw	Although the Earthshaker Terracotta Sentinel is considered an unorthodox design by traditional foundries, no one can deny that it is a perfect combination of artillery and Terracotta Sentinel, nor can anyone ignore its terrifying firepower and battlefield deterrence. The reputation of the Celestial Foundry has been built upon such bold and innovative designs.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_YL_sxdw	The Divine Saltpeter Musket and the Xuan Dao are the latest achievements of the Celestial Foundry. Energy flows between the musket and the blade. Each strike of the Xuan Dao charges the musket, while the heat generated by the musket's firing preheats the Xuan Dao's blade, resulting in even greater destructive power. Mastering the balance of this flow is not easy, so the Divine Saltpeter Bladeguard are all carefully selected warriors from the Dragon Guard, each skilled in both sword and musket combat.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_YL_chlw	The Moon Empress favors archery and often teaches archery to the people of Grand Cathay. As a result, everyone in Cathay is skilled with bows and crossbows. The Remnant Fire units are composed of experienced archers, each with exceptional archery skills. The Moon Empress has granted them Moon Shadow Arrows for protection, and their commonly used Residue Rockets, produced by the Celestial Foundry, are their weapon of choice for disrupting enemy formations.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_YL_hytj	"Still as a fortress, moving like a mountain!" exclaimed Master Qinglian after witnessing the Mountainquaker Iron Cavalry in action. The Mountainquaker Iron Cavalry undergoes harsh training year-round on the windswept plains outside the Great Bastion. They and their horses are clad in black armor, wielding Guan Dao, fearless and unwavering. No matter how powerful the enemy, they charge forward without hesitation.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_YL_zyxj	North of the Great Bastion, long ravaged by Chaos daemons, they often raided the Cathayan border, plundering and then leaving, exhausting the Cathayan defenders. Until one day, the alerted garrison found a Norscan raider force pinned to death by silver spears outside a village. Survivors from the village said they were saved by a group of righteous cavalry riding white horses. From then on, the name "Cloud Chasing Cavalry" gradually spread outside the Great Bastion, becoming a nightmare for Chaos raiders.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_YL_lysw	Yin and Yang harmony is the foundation of Grand Cathay. These powerful Yin Yang Stone Lions are the culmination of Yin Yang beast magic, and every Dualforce Lion Guard is also skilled in wielding dual iron whips. They are all dressed in black robes and silver armor, their black and white whips capable of both offense and defense in battle. Skilled in manipulating Yin and Yang energies, they can even achieve a seamless flow of Yin and Yang in combat, ensuring their stamina never runs out.	false
