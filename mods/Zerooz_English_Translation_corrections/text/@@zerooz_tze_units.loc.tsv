land_units_onscreen_name_tze_inf_centigors_great_sword	Centigors of Tzeentch (Great Swords)	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_tze_inf_centigors_great_sword	Beastmen are creatures of pure Chaos, and thus they serve the four Chaos gods equally. However, sometimes a mother beast will give birth to offspring clearly chosen by the Lord of Change, with markings of Tzeentch on its fur, or horns twisted into symbols of Tzeentch's malevolence. These Centigors are as fierce and vicious as their non-Tzeentch counterparts but harbor a stronger hatred for their own clumsy, stupid nature, leading to deep jealousy towards those with better-matched minds and bodies. This jealousy fuels their rage, making them even more dangerous: given their touch by Tzeentch, this may not be a coincidence.	false
unit_description_short_texts_text_tze_inf_centigors_great_sword	Betrayal, pain, violence, madness… you will experience it all before being torn apart by a savage beast…	false
