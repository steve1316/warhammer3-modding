land_units_onscreen_name_kho_inf_khorngors_dule_axe	Fearsome Khorngor Ravagers	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_unit_long_text_kho_inf_khorngors_dule_axe	The Great Beasts are already among the finest of Chaos spawn, yet even among them, the Fearsome Khorngor is the most dangerous. Their strength surpasses that of other Great Beasts, and as expected, these warriors marked by the God of War are even more ferocious, temperamental, and uncontrollable in their lust for slaughter. Their red armor complements the crimson hide of the Khornate demons, and they charge recklessly into lines that would challenge even other Great Beasts. Among the demonic legions visible on the battlefield, they are undoubtedly the most savage.	false
unit_description_short_texts_text_unit_short_text_kho_inf_khorngors_dule_axe	Khorngor blessed by the Blood God, clad in superior armor, tearing through any foe on the battlefield	false
land_units_onscreen_name_kho_inf_the_red_revelation	Red Revelation	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_unit_long_text_kho_inf_the_red_revelation	This regiment consists of a Slaughter Priest, five Skull Reapers, and ten Bloodstained Berserkers. They roam between realms, not for wealth, but to witness all forms of battle and behold the true visage of the "Red God." Their aim is not victory, but blood and frenzy, making them the most fanatical followers within the Red Blaze.	false
unit_description_short_texts_text_unit_short_text_kho_inf_the_red_revelation	Unbound devotees of Khorne, they fight without traditional Khornate tactics, their bodies twisted by countless mutations	false
land_units_onscreen_name_kho_inf_exalted_eightbound	Exalted Eightbound	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_unit_long_text_kho_inf_exalted_eightbound	The Exalted Eightbound are extreme warriors of Chaos, possessed by eight demons, merging eight souls into a single hybrid combat form. They undergo brutal trials within the "Eightbound Cage," and those who succeed are fused with all eight demons, becoming terrifyingly powerful warriors.	false
unit_description_short_texts_text_unit_short_text_kho_inf_exalted_eightbound	The Eightbound have their souls fully merged with the eight demons, achieving true "Exalted" status, surpassing their peers in both strength and brutality.	false
land_units_onscreen_name_kho_flesh_hound_knight	Flesh-Hound Knights	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_unit_long_text_kho_flesh_hound_knight	On the eternal battlefields of Khorne, efficiency equals devotion. Some Chaos Knights’ thirst for slaughter is so intense that mortal mounts cannot bear their fury. For these chosen "lucky ones," the Blood God’s artisans perform a sacrilegious living-fusion ritual, merging the knight’s lower body with their loyal, bloodthirsty flesh-hound. Bones interlaced, nerves connected, a single, shared killing will is born. Thus is the Flesh-Hound Knight forged.	false
unit_description_short_texts_text_unit_short_text_kho_flesh_hound_knight	Hunting units of the Blood God, fused permanently with their flesh-hounds in dark rites, becoming dual-souled butchers, reveling only in the pure ecstasy of tearing prey apart.	false
land_units_onscreen_name_kho_blood_maiden	Blood Maidens	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_unit_long_text_kho_blood_maiden	Deep within Khorne’s iron fortress, echoes are not only of brutal roars but of the precise whistle of blades through the air. These are the "Blood Maidens"—the personal guard and executioners of the God’s chosen bride, Valkia. They are not rough northern warriors but women selected from countless fighters who demonstrated precision beyond mere fury in battle. Valkia sees in them blades that reflect her own glory.	false
unit_description_short_texts_text_unit_short_text_kho_blood_maiden	The deadly court of the Blood God’s bride. Chosen personally by Valkia, these champions merge the dance of death with a craving for skulls, their strikes so swift only the gush of blood can keep pace.	false
