unit_description_historical_texts_text_rhd_land_skv_inf_clanrats_warpstone_0_long_desc	The majority of Skaven armies are comprised of Clanrats—a horde of ratmen that make up the warrior class. These Skaven belong to countless clans, which are scattered across the tunnels, fortresses, and sprawling cavern cities of the Under-Empire. Among the teeming masses, only the sheer number of enslaved workers and incompetent Skavenslaves can rival the quantity of Clanrats. When a Warlord musters forces for war, Clanrats take the front lines, occupying key positions in the battle formation. They attack in overwhelming numbers and with reckless ferocity to overcome foes. If the Warlord can afford it and maintains good relations with Clan Skryre, weapon teams may join them. However, these destructive magical contraptions often face scrutiny from Clanrats due to frequent malfunctions, causing as much harm to their allies as to their enemies.	false

unit_description_historical_texts_text_rhd_land_skv_inf_skavenslaves_warpstone_0_long_desc	The Under-Empire is built on the labor of slaves. Skavenslaves perform all the menial and backbreaking tasks, such as mining, tunneling, and farming. During times of famine, they themselves become a source of food. These unfortunate Skaven are born into oppression, forming the lowest rung of the rigid social ladder. When rival clans are absorbed during civil wars, their captured members swell the ranks of Skavenslaves. Occasionally, non-Skaven also find themselves enslaved, though few survive for long under the cruel whips of Skaven taskmasters. In wartime, Skavenslaves are driven forward to absorb enemy fire or to overwhelm enemies with sheer numbers. A common Warlord tactic involves sacrificing Skavenslaves as meat shields to weaken foes for more valuable troops. The best Skavenslaves may even manage to kill a few enemies, which is considered a great bargain.	false

unit_description_historical_texts_text_rhd_land_skv_inf_night_runners_warpstone_0_long_desc	Night Runners are the most common warriors of Clan Eshin, though they remain as enigmatic as the rest of the clan. Trained for rapid movement, Night Runners specialize in swift raids, paving the way for Skaven forces. Small, stealthy units seize key strategic points while larger groups harass and slow enemy movements. Most Night Runners wield paired blades, but some are equipped with slings, targeting enemy war machines or lightly armored elites. Their typical strategy involves flanking enemy positions and luring foes into hastily prepared ambushes.	false

unit_description_historical_texts_text_rhd_land_skv_inf_gutter_runners_warpstone_0_long_desc	Within Skaven society, most suspicious deaths and acts of espionage are attributed to the vile machinations of Clan Eshin. These accusations, often true, lack concrete proof, as the culprits—black-clad death squads known as Gutter Runners—vanish without a trace. Gutter Runners are trained in mysterious martial arts techniques imported from the Far East, granting them unparalleled speed and agility. Their combat skills allow them to evade enemy strikes and projectiles with ease, rendering heavy armor unnecessary. Units of Gutter Runners are often led by Deathrunners, individuals destined for the ranks of the Eshin Assassins.	false
