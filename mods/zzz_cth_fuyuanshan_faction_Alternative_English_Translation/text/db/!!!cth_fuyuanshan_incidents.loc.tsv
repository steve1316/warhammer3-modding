incidents_localised_description_fuyuanshan_incidents_intro	Tzeentch's treacherous scheme has succeeded, and the Great Bastion built by the Dragon Emperor has crumbled.

General, please break through the Chaos blockade as soon as possible, rebuild the Great Bastion, sweep away the demonic hordes, and restore peace to Grand Cathay.	false

incidents_localised_description_fuyuanshan_incidents_celestial_tower	Although the Great Bastion has been reclaimed, its power to ward off evil has been lost. To restore peace to Grand Cathay, we must venture into the Chaos Wastes, using the Celestial Towers as conduits to channel the Dragon Emperor's might and rebuild the Great Bastion.\\nAccording to the Astronomer Royal's calculations, the optimal locations for constructing Celestial Towers are in the far north and the far south. These places are ravaged by magical winds, making them inhospitable to ordinary people, but they are highly beneficial for conducting the ritual. However, be cautious, as our ancient enemy, Kairos Fateweaver, has also obtained this information and will undoubtedly try to hinder you in every way possible.	false

incidents_localised_description_fuyuanshan_incidents_xinwu_spawn	For a long time, the Corvidae have been secretly searching for a prophesied child, said to be destined to bring complete destruction to Grand Cathay. They finally set their sights on a general at the Great Bastion, Xin Wu.\\nXin Wu was brave in battle, caring towards his subordinates, cherished the people of Grand Cathay, and was impeccably loyal. Thus, he was deeply admired and considered by all to be the next commander of the Great Bastion.\\nUntil one Chaos attack, in order to turn the tide of the battle, Xin Wu single-handedly charged into the heart of the enemy ranks and dueled with their leader, ultimately perishing together. But just as everyone mourned Xin Wu's death, he miraculously revived.\\nHis achievements and miraculous resurrection earned him unparalleled admiration in the army, but this only confirmed the Corvidae's suspicions. Xin Wu was the one destined to bring destruction to Grand Cathay according to the prophecy.\\nSoon, he and his soldiers were surrounded by the Celestial Dragon Guard led by the Celestial General. Facing Xin Wu's angry and confused gaze, the Celestial General, with the detachment and coldness of a Dragon-God, revealed the contents of the prophecy.\\nUpon learning everything, Xin Wu chose to give up resistance and willingly be executed by the Celestial General, ordering his soldiers who intended to protect him to lay down their arms. But after the execution, the Celestial General broke his promise to Xin Wu to spare the others.\\nIn the name of completely eradicating Chaos influence, the Celestial General ordered the attack. The soldiers who had laid down their arms were lambs to the slaughter before the Celestial Dragon Guard. This was not a war, but a mere massacre.\\nRegret and unwillingness flooded Xin Wu's heart, but he was powerless. His consciousness irreversibly sank into the eternal, cold, and lonely darkness. At that moment, the voices of the four Chaos Gods echoed in his ears. They offered Xin Wu power, in exchange for the use of his body after he fulfilled his revenge.\\nReborn in blood and fire, Xin Wu bestowed cruel death upon his enemies. There were almost no survivors in this battle, and Xin Wu, his hands stained with blood, could no longer consider himself a protector.\\nXin Wu, who dared to defy the Celestial Court, became a symbol. The rule of the Dragon-Gods was not perfect either; their plans, spanning millennia, had caused endless suffering for their people, the construction of the Grand Canal being a prime example.\\nWith each of Xin Wu's victories, nobles, merchants, soldiers, rebels, and even Dragonborn flocked to his banner, as numerous as the trees of Kunlan. He effectively held a third of Grand Cathay in his grasp, a force even the Dragon-Gods could not ignore.\\nIn fact, Miao Ying personally led Cathay's most elite garrison troops south, while Zhao Ming blocked his path. But at this time, Xin Wu also possessed an artifact capable of rivaling the might of the Dragon-Gods - the "Defier of Fate," a gift from the four Chaos Gods, capable of severing the threads of fate and bringing destined death to all things.\\nTzeentch's emissaries diligently painted a picture for Xin Wu of a future Cathay ruled not by Dragon-Gods, but by mortals themselves. All he had to do was eliminate the Dragon-Gods who had usurped the throne. There were many who supported and opposed this idea, and Cathay had never been so divided. While the storm within Cathay was gradually fanned into shape by the Corvidae, the Chaos army was quietly assembling north of the Great Bastion.\\nBut when the Chaos army broke through the Dragon Gate Pass, what awaited them was not the remnants of a fierce battle between Xin Wu and Miao Ying, but both sides raising their spears against the Chaos hordes simultaneously.\\nUnexpectedly, Xin Wu had reached a secret agreement with Miao Ying before the battle, vowing to work together to thwart Chaos' plot and taking on the task of attrition warfare. Although Xin Wu achieved great success in this battle, the soldiers loyal to him suffered heavy casualties. But exchanging blood for Cathay's reacceptance was part of the secret agreement.\\nAfter the battle, Miao Ying swore in the name of the Celestial Dragon Emperor, promising that Grand Cathay would never retaliate against Xin Wu's followers.\\nXin Wu then used his divine sword, the "Defier of Fate," which could bring death to all things, to commit suicide, thus refusing to pay the price to the four Chaos Gods. A group of Xin Wu's loyal followers also followed suit.\\nThis history was later distorted into absurd myths, with only the ancestral monks guarding Xin Wu's body knowing the truth. They understood that the power of the four Chaos Gods was immeasurable, and everything was not over yet. The prophecy still clung to Grand Cathay like a persistent maggot.\\nAnd now, Xin Wu, who once cast a terrifying shadow over Grand Cathay, has been resurrected once again under the manipulation of Tzeentch, coming to destroy Grand Cathay.	false

incidents_localised_description_fuyuanshan_incidents_xinwu_defeated	You desperately try to distract Xin Wu, creating an opportunity for Qu Miao Ling to break the magic controlling him. Finally, just as Xin Wu's sword is about to strike your forehead, the massive, golem-like blade stops, its wind creating a storm. Then, Xin Wu roars and tears all the Chaos soldiers to shreds.\\nAfter everything is over, Xin Wu learns about the current situation in Grand Cathay from you. He promises to provide you with help at the right time.	false
