character_skills_localised_description_wh3_main_skill_innate_fuyuanshan_innate_1	When Miao Ying first met Fu Yuanshan, he was a child who had survived for fifteen days in the ruins ravaged by Chaos. He was so wary upon seeing Miao Ying that he even attempted to attack her.\\nMiao Ying recognized the child's potential and resolved to forge him into a spear thrust into the Chaos Wastes	true
character_skills_localised_description_wh3_main_skill_innate_fuyuanshan_innate_2	Although Miao Ying adopted the child and named him Fu Yuanshan, she did not give him any special treatment. At the age of fifteen, Fu Yuanshan joined the Yeoman Cavalry, starting from the bottom, but quickly demonstrated exceptional horsemanship, as he practically forced himself to live on horseback.\\nThe young Fu Yuanshan believed that relying on human strength alone was not enough to fight against those monsters. Only heavily armored cavalry could crush those demons and monsters head-on and fulfill his desired revenge	true
character_skills_localised_description_wh3_main_skill_innate_fuyuanshan_innate_3	Fu Yuanshan's troops encountered a raiding force that Kairos had magically transported across the Great Bastion. Others suggested retreating immediately and regrouping at the camp to counterattack, but Fu Yuanshan knew this was just empty talk from those who were terrified. He told everyone that if they couldn't defeat the enemy while they were still establishing a foothold, they would surely be hunted down and killed by the Chaos hordes.\\nFu Yuanshan achieved an almost unbelievable success. He led his cavalry in repeated raids, like a violent whip lashing at the Chaos legions. Then, with a brilliant cavalry charge, he shattered the enemy's formation and impaled the leader of the Chaos army on his own spear, causing the other daemonic troops to scatter and flee.\\nHowever, Fu Yuanshan himself was severely wounded by the Chaos leader's counterattack, clinging to life only by his sheer will to survive. At that moment, Miao Ying appeared before him. If Fu Yuanshan had fled during the battle, Miao Ying would never have cared about this mortal's life or death again. But Fu Yuanshan ultimately proved his intense hatred and his matching talent for war. Miao Ying bestowed her own blood upon Fu Yuanshan, creating a Dragonborn who surpassed all others.	true
character_skills_localised_description_wh3_main_skill_innate_fuyuanshan_innate_4	After coming of age, Fu Yuanshan joined the Dragon Horse cavalry and quickly rose through the ranks with his abilities, even catching the eye of the wealthy Nan-Gau merchant Peng Du.\\nPeng Du wanted to marry his daughter to Fu Yuanshan, offering a dowry that could buy half of Nan-Gau. However, Fu Yuanshan refused, saying, "How can I have a family before Chaos is vanquished?" This led to Fu Yuanshan being ostracized by the Nan-Gau merchants, and his comrades mocked his foolishness, but only Fu Yuanshan knew the true reason.\\nFrom then on, Fu Yuanshan continued to rely on his own abilities, earning merits through countless life-and-death battles, and eventually became the commander of the Dragon Horse cavalry.\\nNow, with the most powerful force in Grand Cathay at his disposal, he patiently awaits an opportunity	true
character_skills_localised_description_wh3_main_skill_innate_fuyuanshan_innate_5	The Dragon Emperor's command arrived. Fu Yuanshan, as the most outstanding Dragonborn, would lead the eastern theater of the Great Bastion and launch a sweep of the Chaos forces north of the Bastion alongside Miao Ying in the western theater. But the power of the Dragon Horses alone was not enough; this time, over a thousand Sky-Junks would be dispatched to assist the Dragon Guard in the sweep.\\nFu Yuanshan welcomed his second-in-command, a Cathayan Dwarf who sniffed snuff. He declared that he would use Dwarfen knowledge to aid Fu Yuanshan	true
character_skills_localised_description_wh3_main_skill_innate_fuyuanshan_innate_6	When the Grand Cathayan army crossed the Great Bastion, a thousand Sky-Junks blotted out the sun, and tens of thousands of Dragon Horse cavalry swept across the land like wings of death. The Chaos-tainted tribes that plagued the northern lands were wiped out. Kairos was also defeated by the combined efforts of Miao Ying and Zhao Ming, fleeing back to the Chaos Realms amidst Zhao Ming's taunts in his human form. The border of the Great Bastion enjoyed a long period of peace.\\nOn par with the fame of the two living Dragon-Gods was Fu Yuanshan, a mere mortal whose accomplishments were no less than those of the two deities. He was thus respectfully called the "Dragon General".\\nIn the years that followed, Fu Yuanshan never returned to Nan-Gau, only gazing at the Dragon Emperor's eldest daughter from afar, day after day, guarding the northern border of the Grand Cathayan Empire	true
