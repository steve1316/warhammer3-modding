unit_description_historical_texts_text_f_cth_inf_scout	The Great Bastion Rangers are the most agile group selected from the Yeoman Cavalry. They are skilled in surviving in the Chaos Wastes and are responsible for reconnaissance and patrol work in the areas north of the Great Bastion. Almost every one of them has a similar background to Miao Ying, harboring a deep hatred for Chaos and never compromising or retreating in the face of the great enemy.	true

unit_description_historical_texts_text_f_cth_cav_bastion	The Iron Hail Gunners are heavy cavalry forged by Miao Ying. Compared to the Jade Lancers, they utilize technology from the Kunlan artisans and are equipped with heavy metal armor cast in one piece. This armor features a multi-layered composite of different materials and articulated joint design, making it a product that transcends its time. However, even so, its terrifying weight can only be borne by a few Dragon-blooded steeds. Due to its exceptionally high cost, the Iron Hail Gunners' equipment cannot be used to establish a large-scale standing army. The Iron Hail Gunners on the battlefield cannot even be called cavalry; they are mechanisms driven by the power of warhorses.	true

unit_description_historical_texts_text_cth_fys_jade_warrior_lancer	The heavy cavalry of Grand Cathay is called the Jade Warrior Lancers, and their riders come from various major cities. Large contingents of Jade Warrior Lancers are usually stationed in prosperous cities like Fu Zhou and Wei-Jin, and even the more remote southern and western cities will have at least one such unit. Jade Warrior Lancers are not only adept at fighting in open fields but are also trained to fight in the narrow streets of cities. Whether in narrow alleys, on bridges, or in the tunnels of city walls, they can launch devastating charges. And at the Great Bastion, to resist the Chaos hordes, they wear thicker armor than other Jade Warrior Lancers.	false
