I was thinking special-encounter (not auto-resolveable combat) could be a "tower" or "dungeon"

Starting up, it would give you a super-easy encounter, like fighting lordless zombies, empire-troops, darkspears/darkshards, skinks, nurglings, or skavenslaves.

If you manage to suceed that battle, another dilemma would trigger that asks if you would like to leave the dungeon/tower or dwell deeper/higher; every tower/dungeon is based around a single faction for enemies you face, and every time you decide to "go higher/deeper" it gives you a harder encounter, but with increased reward rarity at each turn, or even potentialy if possible get you 1-5 random units (potentialy from other factions you arent playing) as that swear fealty to you.

(power of mercs would scale on the cleared dungeon-level's strength, so if you beat skeleton-warriors you might get 2-4 skeleton-warriors or equalivent-cost units from other roosters)

On the final or later floor, you would fight an actual-lord with spells/mounts and abilities that boost their troops refered to as the "Master of the Dungeon/Warren", and if you beat them it could give some cool item/rewards, or mayhap even a random hero from a random faction, where the roleplay is that you free-prisoners that swear fealty to you, or that you broke the curse of bla bla whatever n so on.
