When the imperial forces were stretched thin, it was these vigilante heroes, often distrusted by the authorities, who stood in defense of Cathay's vulnerable flank. After the battle, the Celestial Court posthumously honored the fallen heroes with official titles, and Tang Jingyin, the Wulin Alliance Leader, was granted the title "Duke of the Bastion". However, to those who fought alongside him and under his protection, he is remembered simply as the "Grand Hero".	false
