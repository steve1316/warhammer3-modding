missions_localised_description_mission_deer_lingguan_1	The Heavenly Enforcer was born of the winds of qi, a guardian general personally forged by the Dragon Emperor to watch over both Heaven and Earth. It is said he once beheaded a rebellious Dragon Son at the Emperor’s command, taking the son’s claw as a mark of penance before ending his own life under the weight of guilt. The Emperor then affixed the claw to the Enforcer’s blood-soaked neck, and qi surged through him, reviving him. No one knows if the claw carries the Enforcer’s will, only that he unwaveringly executes the Emperor’s will, safeguarding Cathay with blood. Before his departure, the Emperor sent the Enforcer to Tian Shan. Some say his task was to guard against mountain fiends, others claim he watches over the punished Monkey King.

The Emperor had warned of such beings, but he had entrusted the Grand Plan to Yuan Bo—proof of his belief in his son's judgment.\\nAs the Lizardmen warriors shrieked and charged, soldiers' hands trembled on their shields.

Give the order, and I’ll tear the head off that wretched toad myself!”\\n“We must get the Jade Regent to safety first,” said the Martial Saint, removing a mask now chipped by a Slann’s blow. “Their power is no joke. We must return to Pahualaxa at once.”\\n“You’re right. But the Grand Admiral is gone. We’ll need to tread carefully.”\\n“An Ruibang died in the ambush?” Yuan Bo caught raindrops in his hand, a mirror in his palm reflecting the jungle’s poison fog.\\n“...No, my lord. But I haven’t seen him since you entered the inner city. Our forces scattered for watch duty.”\\nYuan Bo felt the winds of magic stir.\\n“Find him.”	true

Dragon child, I...apologize,” Mazdamundi slurred, his obese frame pulsing atop the throne. Yuan Bo found it grotesque—especially after so many Cathayan deaths. Rage stirred in his blood, but he bit down the insult.\\n“I accept your apology, Master. We have both paid dearly. But in the grander scheme, these losses are insignificant—we both know that.”\\n“Yes... the end... the Old Ones... foresaw it. I... already know... your aim. We... cannot accept... the warm-bloods, but... our goals... align.”\\nThe Slann’s rumbling throat spoke the words Yuan Bo most longed to hear.\\n“Then we are in agreement?”\\n“Yes...”	true

missions_localised_description_mission_wwd_ll_miaoyin_story_fangwenzi_I	Retaking East Wind Fortress was only the beginning.\\nAnother vile pink daemon is torn apart under Cathayan bolt volleys—but death is but a doorway for such entities. The yurts lie still as tombs; the nomads, their eyes gouged out, cower in the shadows. The Iron Cavalry once again gallops across the Twelve Hills, yet the taint of Chaos has erased all signs of the land’s former vitality.\\n\\n“Submission is proceeding as expected, Lady Soaring Dragon,” Fang Wenzi said, cradling an armful of scrolls.\\n“Most tribes have accepted our rule, but the taint runs deep. There are still stubborn fools...” He unrolled a complex southern desert map before Miao Ying. “I’ve handled most unrest, but fleeing bandits are converging east, dangerously close to the Cursed Spirits’ domain.”\\n“A new map?” Miao Ying raised a brow.\\n“Drawn last night, my lady—but that’s not the point. The locals treat those mountains as the world’s edge, but I believe they know that’s false. It’s religious dogma. The Astronomical Minister confirms abnormal magic winds in those peaks. Scouts report auditory hallucinations—voices... names... something is wrong.”\\n“This is the Chaos Wastes, Fang Wenzi. Nothing should surprise you here.”\\n“Yes, my lady. But to truly control the region, we must solve this mystery. They call it the Whispering Mountains. I believe the key to the northern campaign lies there.”\\n\\n[[img:event_mission_neutral]][[/img]][[col:red]]Warning: This will initiate a highly challenging mission[[/col]]	true

missions_localised_description_mission_wwd_ll_miaoyin_story_fangwenzi_II	Miao Ying regretted not inspecting East Wind Fortress personally.\\n\\nHer army now stands at the ritual’s heart.\\n\\nVictory on the Wastes brought joy to the Soaring Dragon—but her disciplined mind remained alert. The dragons have battled Chaos for millennia. She had never underestimated her foe—yet the recent grueling war was merely the opening gambit. Chaos had rooted itself deep in the land. This desolation was proof.\\n“I should have seen it.” Life used as sacrifice—Chaos’s standard trick, isn’t it? Even if the altar is the entire battlefield, the entire Wastes.\\n“I doubt even the Moon Empress would blame you under these circumstances, my lady,” Fang Wenzi’s voice, amid the chaos of war, sounded like a whisper from across the world—yet Miao Ying had long viewed that voice as thunder. This mortal understood the world with unmatched clarity—perhaps more than she did. He was her compass for correct judgment. “The scale of this ritual is unprecedented. Even with a nearby rift, and this many lives sacrificed, the army it summoned is far too small for the cost.”\\nFang Wenzi struggled to stay upright under the howling magic, his voice steady, but sweat streaked his cheek. Miao Ying saw it—this was beyond even the “Moon Immortal’s” calculations.\\n“We must retreat to Blood Wind—I mean East Wind Fortress. Yi Qing’s army is still regrouping at Changyuan. We can’t expect reinforcements large enough to retake the Bone Forge. But I can work with the Astronomical Ministers to—”\\n“East Wind Fortress has fallen! Fang Wenzi, can’t your Wind of Spirit sense that sorrowful tremor? The fortress was a ritual node! We are now stranded. It’s fight or die!”\\nHer fury at his calm response surprised her—she had hoped he would see what she couldn’t. But he had failed... or was it her own projection? She had chosen to advance east. The blame was hers. Now was not the time for anger. Tens of thousands of frontier troops depended on her.\\n“Forget what I said. Fang Wenzi, we break south. Ao Gate is close—we will not let the soldiers of Cathay die in this accursed place!”\\nFang Wenzi’s gaze flickered—was he calculating the odds, or surprised at the Soaring Dragon’s sudden rage? Miao Ying didn’t care. He was just one among thousands—and she had vowed to bring them all home.	true
