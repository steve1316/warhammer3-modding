missions_localised_description_mission_wwd_meihouwang_wh3_1	The Monkey King tirelessly sends his monkeys and apes to deliver letters across all courts: the great Monkey King has completed the trial set by the Dragon Emperor. Long ago, he successfully escorted the Dragon Emperor's envoy westward to the land of a thousand gods. While none can verify this, the Monkey King claims it was all at the Dragon Emperor's behest.

The monkeys dwell behind the waterfall in their hollowed grotto, a place you might call paradise if not for the cacophony of monkey chatter. The Monkey King sits idly on his throne, his eyes lighting up as he recognizes you instantly—your name is known across Cathay. He has meticulously studied which Cathayan figures to sway, at least from a monkey's perspective. In a flash, he is before you, his movements too quick for your eyes. His prowess is undeniable. Were it not for his jovial demeanor, your instincts might compel you to guard against this formidable figure. He invites you to a crude meeting hall pieced together by his monkey soldiers. Now, it is time to talk business.	true
campaign_payload_ui_details_description_dummy_WWD_meihouwang2	To gain recognition from the Cathayan courts, the Monkey King requires a figure of substantial influence within Cathay to vouch for him.

missions_localised_title_mission_WWD_lingguan_1	Heavenly Watcher · Part 1	true
missions_localised_description_mission_WWD_lingguan_1	The Heavenly Watcher was born from the winds of magic, created by the Dragon Emperor as a guardian to oversee both the heavens and the mortal realm. Legend has it that under the Emperor's command, it executed a rebellious dragon prince and claimed its claw. Later, crushed by guilt over killing its kin, it took its own life. The Dragon Emperor grafted the claw onto the Watcher's bleeding neck, and through the winds of magic, it was resurrected. None can say whether the claw carries the Watcher's original consciousness, but it continues to fulfill the Emperor's will, securing Cathay's peace at great cost. Before departing, the Emperor sent the Watcher to Tianshan. Some say it was to keep the southern monsters in check; others believe it was to watch over the punished Monkey King. Since then, the Heavenly Watcher has vanished. Despite having no eyes, its spiritual power is said to observe every corner of Cathay. Should a crisis arise, it is believed the Watcher will return to the mortal realm. We should head to Fuhong to gather more information.	true

Hou Qian, using cloud-riding techniques, intercepted the Monkey King in Kunlan Mountain. Were it not for the Monkey King being pressed for time, he might have wreaked havoc once more, but instead, he fought hastily. Hou Qian, already a formidable warrior, overwhelmed the Monkey King, piercing his defenses with the dazzling light of his twin-bladed spear. Yet, the Monkey King, with his extraordinary skills, launched counterattacks that stunned Hou Qian. Realizing the dire situation, Hou Qian brandished a mystical axe bestowed by the Elder Immortal of Kunshan and struck at the Monkey King.
