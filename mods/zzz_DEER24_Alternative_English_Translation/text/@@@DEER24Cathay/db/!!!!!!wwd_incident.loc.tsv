dilemmas_localised_description_wwd_ll_dilemma_battle_of_weijin	Amidst fire and ashes, light pierces the darkness. The rebellion of the King of Nan Yang heralds chaos across Cathay. Once a celebrated general who crushed countless uprisings for the Dragon Emperor, he now leads an army to topple the eternal dynasty. Former comrades turn against one another, brothers-in-arms now bitter enemies. Half of the northern provinces have pledged themselves to his cause, vowing to overthrow the celestial reign.\\n\\nThe Celestial Strategists’ generals rallied to counter the rebellion, dispatching three great armies. Yet, each was decisively defeated: General Tianxian fell at the Grave Plains under a storm of arrows from the "Duke of Xuanhuan"; General Mingjing was lured into a trap by the "Marquis of Jingji," meeting his end at a banquet; and General Hubu, despite his battlefield prowess, was impaled by the "Marquis of Wuqiu." The Celestial court stands paralyzed by fear and confusion, for the King of Nan Yang seems to foresee every strategy, aiming to annihilate the Dragon Emperor’s forces.\\n\\nAmidst this turmoil, only the Dragon Emperor’s Champion remains composed. His decision is clear: the Imperial Guard shall march from the capital to annihilate the rebel coalition near the Jewel City. As it was a century ago, no one will threaten the capital while he stands.	false

For many, this bond is not just political—it signifies Yihan’s inclusion in the culture of the Celestial Dragon.\\nThrough Miao Ying’s tireless efforts in the southern steppes, the threat of the Kurgan has largely been suppressed. Yet a greater peril brews in the Red Wastes: Chilu was once a key fortress of Cathay’s northern defense line, bridging Yihan’s Four Counties and Six Garrisons. Together, their armies built a solid defense between Chilu and the Hemugu line, weakening and dividing the northern warlords. But after "The Cursed Spirit" seized Chilu, their joint defense was shattered.\\nFollowing several defeats, Cathay withdrew to Longkui Road in the southern steppes.

dilemmas_localised_description_wwd_ll_miaoyin_story_fangwenzi_I	Recapturing Eastwind Fortress was only the beginning.\\nAnother despicable pink demon was torn asunder beneath Cathay’s sharp bolts, yet for these otherworldly beings, death is but a step toward rebirth. The yurts were silent as tombs, and the herders—deprived of their eyes—cowered in the shadows. Once more, the Iron Cavalry of the Celestial Empire thundered across the Twelve Mountains of the Great Desert, but Chaos’s corruption had long since wiped away the verdant past.\\n\\n"As expected, the submission proceeded smoothly, Lord Soaring Dragon." Fang Wenzi, arms filled with scrolls, stepped before Miao Ying.\\n"Most chose to accept our rule, but the desert is too far gone. In every tribe, there are still... stubborn fools." He drew out a scroll at random and spread it on Miao Ying’s table—it was a map of the southern desert, meticulously marked.\\n"But I’ve dealt with the unrest. The scattered bandits all fled east into the mountains, perilously close to the Cursed Spirits’ domain."\\n"A new map?" Miao Ying raised an eyebrow.\\n"Drawn last night, my lady, but that’s not the point. The locals regard those mountains as the end of the world, but I believe even by their limited geography, they must know the continent doesn’t stop there. It’s religious fervor, my lady. The Astronomical Minister is certain that the magical winds there behave abnormally. The scouts’ reports remain vague. Their minds have been heavily disturbed—they say they hear whispers, a name... something is clearly wrong."\\n"This is the Chaos Wastes, Fang Wenzi. Nothing here should surprise you."\\n"Indeed, my lady. But if we are to press north, we must face this riddle directly. The locals call it the Whispering Mountains. The answer lies there."\\n\\n[[img:event_mission_neutral]][[/img]][[col:red]]Warning: This will begin an extremely challenging mission[[/col]]	false

dilemmas_localised_description_wwd_ll_miaoyin_story_fangwenzi_II	Miao Ying began to regret not personally investigating Eastwind Fortress.\\n\\nNow her army stood at the heart of a great ritual.\\n\\nVictory on the Wastes had pleased the Soaring Dragon, but her mind remained sharp and vigilant. The dragons have wrestled with Chaos for millennia—she never underestimated such a deep and shadowy enemy. Yet that battle, grueling as it was, had only been a piece of the snare. No one foresaw it. The power of Chaos had seeped into the very earth. The blighted land itself was proof enough.\\n\\n"I should have seen this coming!" To sacrifice lives is Chaos’s favored method, even if the altar is an entire battlefield—a whole wasteland.\\n"I’m sure even the Moon Empress would not blame you under these circumstances, Lord Soaring Dragon." Fang Wenzi’s voice, carried on the wind of battle, sounded like a whisper from miles away—but Miao Ying had come to treat that voice like a thunderclap. This mortal’s grasp of the world was perhaps even deeper than her own. He was her compass, ensuring the Soaring Dragon stayed her course.\\n"A spell of this scale... unheard of. Even with the rift to the Demon Realm nearby, even with so many lives offered, the summoned force is nowhere near enough." Fang Wenzi struggled to remain standing amidst the arcane howls. His voice was steady as ever, though sweat ran down his cheek. Miao Ying could see: the situation had long since spiraled beyond even the Moonlit Immortal’s foresight.\\n"We must retreat to Redwind—I mean, Eastwind Fortress. Yi Qing’s army is still regrouping at Changyuan. The enemy’s numbers... we cannot expect reinforcements in time. But I can still coordinate with the Astronomical Ministers to..."\\n"Eastwind Fortress has already fallen! Fang Wenzi, has your gift for Qi Wind not told you of that dreadful tremor? Eastwind’s node was part of the ritual circle—we’re cut off now. It’s fight or die!"\\nHis words sparked nameless rage in Miao Ying’s heart. She had trusted the Moonlit Immortal to guide her blind spots, yet he failed her? No... it was she who chose this advance. She was only projecting her failure onto this poor mortal. Tens of thousands of border troops still relied on her. This was no time for fury.\\n"Forget what I said, Fang Wenzi. We break south—Ao Gate is but a short march. I will not sit idle while Cathayan soldiers die in vain!"\\nA flicker of hesitation crossed Fang Wenzi’s eyes—was he calculating the odds of escape, or surprised by the Soaring Dragon’s sudden rage? Miao Ying no longer cared. He was just one of the countless mortals behind her—and she had sworn to bring them all home.	false

Miao Ying’s power was endless, but it could not carry her fury like a boat upon a flood. Her storm raged across the skies, her wrath boiled through the ranks—but her claws could not grasp sand, nor restore the drifting lives. All fronts were failing. The Dragon’s eyes met the vacant gaze of the dead, and she swore that the mortals she promised to return had already bled dry. The Soaring Dragon roared at the heavens. She tore apart Chaos warriors, ripped bird-demons asunder—but this divine strength, so overwhelming, was powerless. The Dragon Emperor’s honor was meaningless here. The shattering of life echoed with finality.\\n"Soaring Dragon... bring them home," came that voice again—like a great bell.\\nFang Wenzi struggled to his feet behind her. Before her immortal form, his frail mortal frame seemed no more than a bundle of sticks in a storm, bloodied and gaunt.\\n"I tried... Fang Wenzi... I truly tried..." Her broken fingers reached for his claws, but his cold touch silenced her.\\n"You’ve done enough, Soaring Dragon." His voice was weary, aged—almost a whisper. His mastery of Qi Wind had reached the pinnacle of mortalkind, but it had cost him everything to support this doomed stand.\\n"Behind the dragons, mortals feel every second of your helplessness—but still, we marched here. You were born miracles. You cannot fathom what we see as miraculous. Mortals are born small... but we witnessed miracles our whole lives. So we dream of making miracles too."\\nShe saw the dust scatter from his shoulders. This dying soul shone like a falling star.\\n"Fang Wenzi, what are you doing?"\\n"The Dragon Emperor saved all peoples from darkness. He walked with mortals. He created Cathay. He wrote our history."\\n"Stop—this is a direct order!"\\n"Do not be afraid, dragon."\\n"Stop!"\\n"You don’t have to... *cough*... walk into the dark alone."\\n"Fang Wenzi, no!"\\n"You are not alone... mortals walk beside you."\\n\\nDawn broke.\\n\\nA warm wind carried dust home.\\n\\nThe Celestial Bridge rose from the Wastes.	false

Miao Ying sat beside him, as cold and calm as ever. Were it not for the bloodstains on her armor, he might have believed the brutal battle a dream. "Well done. I witnessed your miracle."\\nFang Wenzi nearly felt ashamed. He had prepared for sacrifice, yet here he was, once again defying all odds.\\n"I spoke too boldly, Lady Soaring Dragon... Please, do not mock me. What... happened?"\\n"I’m not mocking you, Fang Wenzi. Opening the Celestial Bridge from nothing may mean little to my father—but to us? To my knowledge, no one in the imperial clan could accomplish such a feat."\\nHe tried to read emotion from the dragon’s jade face, but it was eternally unchanging—ageless, expressionless.\\n"Not even you?"\\n"Not even me, Fang Wenzi." Miao Ying slowly shook her head. That face remained indistinct.\\n"I always viewed humankind as weak, like the small tribe from a thousand years ago—stumbling, helpless without us. Over the years, they’ve mastered scheming but gained little else."\\nShe rose, turning her back on the motionless mortal form. Her silhouette blocked the sun. Fang Wenzi closed his eyes, sensing her dragon gaze fixed on the rising sun. He knew her face bore no expression, yet he still couldn’t help but imagine what she looked like.\\n"You’ve changed my view, Fang Wenzi. Not just you, but all the soldiers who fought beside us. How did we even break through? If you keep creating miracles like this... I may need a word other than ‘mortals’ for your kind."\\nHer voice carried neither joy nor sorrow—like a divine oracle. Surely her face was the same: veiled, distant, like a miracle.\\n"Now, get up, Fang Wenzi. I said I’d bring all of you home. You’re the last."\\n\\nHe opened his eyes.\\nHe was wrong.\\nA radiant smile graced that jade face.	false

dilemmas_localised_description_wwd_ll_yuanbo_story_conflict	Yuan Bo had never doubted the Dragon Emperor’s will, yet now his mind was restless.\\n\\nThe Jade Dragon, executioner of the Dragon Emperor’s justice and regent of the empire, was personally entrusted with the mandate before the Emperor returned to the Celestial Vault.\\n"Continue your charge in my absence, my son. The armies of Cathay will march with you."\\n"I foresee a grim future, yet hope remains. The fate of the world lies in our hands. I cannot err, and neither can you, my son. You must not."\\nThe Emperor’s trust left Yuan Bo both honored and uneasy. The distant coastline and the unfamiliar jungle beyond it stirred doubt within him—he would be leaving Cathay in its time of greatest need. A betrayal of his regent’s duty. He drew a deep breath, steadying his spirit. The Dragon Emperor had chosen the path. He could hesitate no longer.\\n"My lord, we have arrived," came the knock on the cabin door from the grand admiral of the dragon fleet, his soft voice firm with authority. An Ruibang, having gained the trust of the Four Dukes from but a single meeting in Fuzhou, now stood as the backbone of the expedition in the absence of Yi Qing and Jiang Wang.\\n"Thank you, An Ruibang. Once we land, I’ll need your guidance again. Not many Cathayans have come this far."\\n"Humbly at your service, Lord Jade Dragon. Welcome to Lustria."	false

dilemmas_localised_description_wwd_ll_yuanbo_story_conflict_I	As the Battle of Pahakos entered its third month, ancient creatures emerged in silence.\\n\\nOnly the most well-traveled Cathayan adventurers had ever heard the name of the Lizardmen, and even then, they were considered akin to the serpentfolk that Lignan guards against day and night. These scaly beings seemed to be some distant reptilian kin. They emerged from the jungle and approached the siege lines slowly, their cold-blooded nature evoking a dreadful premonition of bloodshed in Xue Ding’s mind. The besieging forces maintained only minimal containment of the Orcs, while the remaining Jade Warriors gathered in the central ranks, forming shield walls and nocking arrows.\\n"This is not the kind of pincer trap I wanted, Xue Ding. Do not attack until they show open hostility," Yuan Bo pressed down on the command banner in Xue Ding’s hand, eyes locked on a massive figure emerging from the dense foliage. That bloated form floated on a star-stone-carved platform, its skin inscribed with constellations— a Slann, proxy of the Old Ones. The Dragon Emperor had warned him of their potential threat, and that the Emperor now entrusted him with the Great Plan showed his confidence in Yuan Bo’s judgment. That judgment now urged him to avoid a war with two races at once.\\nThe Lizardmen ignored the tension. The Skink Warriors beneath the platform screeched in unison and advanced on the Cathayan lines. Yuan Bo could see his soldiers’ hands trembling as they raised their shields, the taut bowstrings fraying. He gently corrected a nearby Jade Warrior’s aim and stepped forward. "Steady your hand, soldier." If conflict could not be avoided, the Dragonfang would gladly be the first to taste blood.\\n"False... dragon... you... should not... be here. But we... share a... common foe."\\nYuan Bo exhaled deeply.	false
dilemmas_localised_description_wwd_ll_yuanbo_story_conflict_II	The expedition stalled.\\n\\nLord Mazdamundi had foreseen a future much like the one envisioned by the Dragon Emperor. Thus, he showed an unusual level of tolerance—at least by Lizardmen standards—toward the warmbloods venturing into the jungle. Though the expedition was still barred from advancing deeper, Mazdamundi permitted Yuan Bo's actions elsewhere in Pahualaxa. The Lustria campaign had taken an unexpected turn. The Lizardmen and Cathayans were now interacting more frequently, and what had been a great threat now looked like a possible ally. But since their stay at the Temple of Sotego, calls for war grew louder.\\n\\nXue Ding and the Wusheng both knew that one of the Dragon Emperor’s targets was Mazdamundi’s stronghold—Hexoatl.\\n"I have crushed countless enemies in your name. By the Dragon Emperor, these Lizardmen live in ways utterly contrary to ours. You cannot make such a foolish mistake—"\\n"Xue Ding, mind your place. You are a member of the Four Dukes’ Inner Council. Your duty is to carry out my orders, not question my decisions!"\\n"You told us the Dragon Emperor's stance on these cold-blooded beasts! Look at yourself! What’s next? You’ll make them a lineage of the Dragonblooded?"\\n"Leave."\\n"The Emperor has made His will clear, and yet you defy it!"\\n"Leave!" Yuan Bo swept the documents from the table in a fury. "Out, Xue Ding! Don’t force me to replace the Grand Protector General!"\\nXue Ding glared, barely restraining himself. Without bowing, he turned on his heel. "Xue takes his leave."\\n\\nThe Wusheng saw a fleeting weariness on Yuan Bo’s face. "You think this is defying the Emperor’s will, do you, ■■?" Even the Wusheng had forgotten that name—his mortal self long gone. He had served the Jade Dragon for over a century and was now his most trusted adviser.\\n"You know there’s truth in Xue Ding’s words, Lord Jade Steward. The Lizardmen still won’t let us enter Hexoatl. At this rate, we may never fulfill the Emperor’s Great Plan. How long do we have before the prophecy of the Celestial Order expires? I support you, Yuan Bo, but I need to know why you would rather delay the plan than go to war."\\n"The End Times, ■■. My father saw it—how the defenders of Order destroy each other in civil strife, wasting their strength. When they finally turn to face the true threat, it will be too late. He told me everything he and my mother saw, then passed the Great Plan to me because he believed I could choose rightly despite knowing the world’s doom. Chaos is still in its infancy, but it will grow to devour all. We cannot stop it alone. Let the other Dragonchildren wield rhetoric in court—I must plan everything to delay that dreadful fate. I will gather any strength that can oppose Chaos, even the agents of the Old Ones. I’ve begun talks with the Slann regarding entry into Hexoatl. There will be progress soon."\\nThe Wusheng finished his tea, capped the cup, and nodded solemnly. "As you will, Jade Dragon. Then give the order."\\n"First, find Xue Ding. Tell him next time, he must not shout at me."	false

dilemmas_localised_description_wwd_ll_yuanbo_story_conflict_III	The fragile peace shattered in an instant.\\n\\nYuan Bo had spent an entire season negotiating with Lord Mazdamundi about the observatory. At the Slann’s command, the Lizardmen had shown courtesy, and their cold-blooded demeanor seemed to soften. Then, without warning, Mazdamundi’s toad-like eyes flared open. His scaly fingers traced a glyph on a crystal stele, and the entire pyramid complex of Hexoatl resonated.\\n"Trai...tor!" The roar from the Skink Priest cracked the jade armor of the guards, and the Temple Guard on either side crossed their obsidian halberds. Yuan Bo glimpsed the stone beneath his soldiers’ feet tremble and then shoot upward, crushing armor and flesh into pulp.\\n"You dare defile the leyline!"\\nWhat happened at Hexoatl was not merely a massacre—it was a ritual. The leyline network erupted with energy. Beasts howled in every direction, and the jungle's Lizardmen launched a coordinated assault on the Cathayan troops.\\n"Stop, Mazdamundi! This is a misunderstanding!" Yuan Bo bellowed, transforming into his draconic form and unleashing spells to save his officers.\\n"I knew these damn lizards were up to no good—but what is happening?!" Xue Ding’s troops burst into the hall and rallied beside Yuan Bo. "Cathayans must withdraw from the jungle immediately!"\\n\\nNo mage could ignore the winds of magic pulsing from the Dragon Fleet, yet the dockworkers remained unaware. They continued loading cargo while the harbor's clamor drowned out the whispers within the ship holds.\\n"The Cult of Painted Skin’s prophecy nears fulfillment. Fuzhou will be the anchor for a shattered reality," An Ruibang raised a strange stone idol—an artifact of the Old Ones, a leyline keystone. He could taste the potential it held.\\n"All for the Changer of Ways."	false

My lord, these are all that remain from the jungle retreat." Rain battered Xue Ding’s helmet, but even the wrathful visage of his mask paled compared to the fury in his heart. "This is an insult to the Dragon Emperor! Give the order, my lord, and I’ll bring you that toad’s head—they must pay in blood!"\\n"We must get the Jade Steward to safety first." The Wusheng removed his mask, revealing a sacred relic now cracked from a Slann’s strike. "Their magic is formidable. We must return to Pahualaxa and regroup."\\nXue Ding nodded reluctantly. "You're right... but the Grand Admiral is gone. The way back won’t be easy."\\n"An Ruibang died in the attack?" Yuan Bo caught a falling raindrop in his palm—within it, a mirror that reflected the toxic mists slithering through the jungle.\\n"...No, my lord.

dilemmas_localised_description_wwd_ll_fina_battle_death_count021_story	Balls of fire pierced the thick clouds of dust kicked up by the violent impact. The thunderous salvo of the Terrorquake Cannons collapsed Longmen Pass’s crumbling walls, leaving a spiral trail of smoke in the sky like ink spilled into a stream. Flames still danced among the shattered ruins, the devastation carved by artillery a deep scar across Cathay's very flesh. Ye Jiangzhou moved quickly through the blistering heat—nightmarish scenes swirling around him. He remembered the day the Imperial Decree was issued, the shining banners of the Palace Guard, fifteen provinces’ armies assembled, nearly a million soldiers crowding every inch of land. For the first time, he truly understood Cathay’s might. Never had he felt so powerful. The Celestial Order thundered: Cathay would defend the Bastion at all costs—no one would pass that line, friend or foe.\\nThe Dragon Guard stood at the fore, followed by the Jade Braves. Corpses formed hills beneath the walls, wave after wave of warriors falling to no avail. The barrier between worlds had been torn asunder, and Chaos surged forth without end. The defenders had fallen back to their final line; fewer than ten thousand remained. Ye Jiangzhou heard the generals arguing, saw their faces harden—Kuaimen and Aomen had fallen. Longmen stood isolated. Only ruin awaited them—first them, then all of Cathay.\\n\\nTears welled in his eyes. He thought of his sister, his home. If all would be lost, then what had all the sacrifice been for?\\n\\nYe Jiangzhou stood with the border troops. They would cover the retreat of the last elite units to Weijing. Even if only a sliver of strength remained, as long as they had not given up, Cathay’s fate was not yet sealed. He gazed upon the ocean of enemies preparing for the final assault—this would be his end.\\n"Soldiers, to me—strike them down! History will remember this day. Cathay will remember our names!"\\nAt least, he thought, I’ll die a hero.\\n\\nThe last of the border troops roared as they charged into the horde, like crashing waves trying to slay the sea. The bombardment continued—the world itself seemed to cry out. Infernos toppled towers, searing heat boiled the streets. Ye Jiangzhou lay among the dead. He never imagined he could bring down the monstrous spawn of Chaos. How many had he slain? He couldn’t recall. Longmen Pass was engulfed in flame. Agonizing pain wrapped his entire being. Blood and heat rose as one.\\nThen finally, darkness fell. Ye Jiangzhou felt nothing at all.	false

It should have held... but it too has fallen.\\nYe and his fellow levymen made their last stand in the square, but it was in vain. Since fleeing Changyuan, he had sharpened his spear endlessly, dreaming of piercing Cathay’s enemies. But it shattered on a Chaos champion’s ironclad. The levies’ arms were brittle as cicada wings. Their hardened bodies broke like threads before axes. Lives became specks in an hourglass of slaughter.\\nThe line shattered. Chaos swept in. Ye was knocked down by panicked allies. Blood and mud coated his face. Groping blindly in crimson fog, he was struck hard in the chest. Laughter from the Chaos brute rang in his ears. An axe’s whistle pierced his heart. He wept. Not from pain—but despair.\\nHe had dreamed of a heroic death. Of his homeland. Of his sister. But now... only emptiness.\\nYet death did not come. A hulking form fell beside him. A glaring severed head rolled to his hand. A golden figure stood above—crimson tassel billowing.\\n"Rise, mortal. Head east to Weijing with the others. I’ll handle the rest."	false

dilemmas_localised_description_wwd_ll_miaoyin_story_beifa_step_I	When Mars invades the Heart constellation, it portends chaos from the barbarians. Since the Dragon Emperor retreated into the Celestial Tower, Cathay's northern bastion has fractured into three Chaos hordes, grazing their steeds on the Jadeflow and loosing arrows at Longmen Gate year after year. For seventy-two years, the beacon towers of Changyuan have known no peace. Seven or eight in every ten border guards lie dead on the frontier, and fifteen inner provinces have conscripted all able-bodied men. Granaries are drained like snow upon boiling water.\\nYet I bring word from the front: the Great Khan of the northern steppes has perished in his golden yurt. His banner, nine tassels and a white standard, lies torn in the shadow winds. The khans of each court battle upon the wide plains, blood churning the waters, vultures blotting the sky.\\nAs when Kurghan’s sons warred and the empire claimed the East Wind, or when the Huo Tribe split east and west and the frontier seized Khatan—\\nSo too did Xinwu cross the desert to seal the border, and Yi Huan hunted wolves at Wolf’s Jaws. Now, the steppe devours itself. This is Heaven’s chance to avenge Cathay’s shame. Should a new khan rise, the fires of Changyuan may burn for another hundred years!	false
