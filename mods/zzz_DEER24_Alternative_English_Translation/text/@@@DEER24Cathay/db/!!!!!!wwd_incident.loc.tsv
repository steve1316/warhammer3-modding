Former comrades turn against one another, brothers-in-arms now bitter enemies. Half of the northern provinces have pledged themselves to his cause, vowing to overthrow the celestial reign.\\n\\nThe Celestial Strategists’ generals rallied to counter the rebellion, dispatching three great armies. Yet, each was decisively defeated: General Tianxian fell at the Grave Plains under a storm of arrows from the "Duke of Xuanhuan"; General Mingjing was lured into a trap by the "Marquis of Jingji," meeting his end at a banquet; and General Hubu, despite his battlefield prowess, was impaled by the "Marquis of Wuqiu." The Celestial court stands paralyzed by fear and confusion, for the King of Nan Yang seems to foresee every strategy, aiming to annihilate the Dragon Emperor’s forces.\\n\\nAmidst this turmoil, only the Dragon Emperor’s Champion remains composed. His decision is clear: the Imperial Guard shall march from the capital to annihilate the rebel coalition near the Jewel City.

dilemmas_localised_description_wwd_final_defender	The nobles of the provinces gather in the capital, followed by the generals who have waged wars across the land. For centuries, the Divine Strategy Office has never been so crowded. Brilliant military strategists propose varied plans to counter Chaos, each given space to elaborate. However, the game of war allows only two players, and now the entire might of Cathay converges under your command. By the grace of the Dragon God, Cathay’s fate depends on your decisions.\\n\\nThe burden of such a vast empire weighs heavily upon you. Until the Dragon Emperor returns, only you can shoulder this responsibility. As you enter the Divine Strategy Office, the noise ceases. Governors and generals kneel before you, while rival courtiers nod their respect. The contentious topics are presented, and your decisions will shape Cathay's destiny. Though the Great Bastion remains impenetrable, we must prepare for the worst. If the Three Gates fall, the north will be left defenseless. How shall we position our forces then?	false

dilemmas_localised_description_wwd_final_defender2	Ye Jiangzhou is the quintessential southerner in the eyes of the border armies—raised along the Grand Canal, enjoying the wealth brought by trade, and accustomed to leisurely evenings by moonlit waters. Skilled in debate but untested in action, or so the perception goes. The truth is, Cathay’s vastness means most never venture beyond their birthplace, living through tales from traveling storytellers.\\n\\nSummoned from Wai Li Village, Jiangzhou, like his peers, found himself in the unfamiliar martial land of Fuhong within weeks. Believing his destiny lay in lifelong tea farming, he was shocked by the sudden draft. Fuhong’s warriors, famed for their prowess, rarely allowed civilians onto battlefields. Jiangzhou once followed masked soldiers to a tea ceremony, curious if they ate like ordinary men beneath their masks—only to find they did.\\n\\nNow, in uncertain times, imperial orders cannot be refused. Hundreds from riverside villages have been conscripted and sent north. Jiangzhou reflects on leaving behind his sister and their shared longing for plum blossom cakes, only to be overwhelmed by Mingzhu City, Cathay’s second largest metropolis. Towering structures surpass all expectations; noise and crowds unsettle him.\\n\\nUpon reaching the Bastion, Jiangzhou trains daily beneath towering walls. Each village mirrors his hometown, yet without his quarrelsome sister, he grows uneasy. Stories of Chaos armies crossing seas to devastate Cathay magnify his anxiety.\\n\\nBeneath your command, additional reinforcements were drawn to the Bastion. Norscan raids proved devastating beyond council projections. The Great Bastion holds firm; as long as it stands, so does hope. But Cathay's fate is unforgiving.

Feeble humans are unworthy opponents compared to tiger warriors. But dragons? Yes, Cathay’s dragons! In Ind, he had heard the name of the Zhu Dragon, ruler of the martial southern provinces.
