loading_screen_quotes_description_wwd_quotes_jinjun01	Among Cathay's eight imperial guard forces, there is a clear hierarchy: the most elite are the Dragon Emperor's Imperial Guard. These peerless warriors, already one in ten thousand as mortals, are further blessed by the Dragon God and armed with celestial weapons, making them unparalleled under the heavens. Next are the Jade Court Sentinels, Southern Candle Guardians, and Longjiang Celestial Masters, who also receive divine blessings, elevating them above the mortal realm. The remaining units, though equipped with the finest weapons and possessing unmatched bravery, are ultimately mortal and cannot compare to the former.	true
loading_screen_quotes_description_wwd_quotes_jinjun02	Though the Dragon Emperor's Imperial Guard primarily serve as celestial palace wardens, their authority outside the Heavenly Court surpasses that of ordinary generals or governors. To mortals, each member of the Imperial Guard represents the Dragon Emperor himself. They can even take command of a general's office through power or strength, and most Haotian generals are as powerless before them as ants before a cart wheel.	true
loading_screen_quotes_description_wwd_quotes_jinjun03	Amid increasing turmoil, unseen currents stir within the Celestial Empire. Some believe it teeters on the edge of collapse. As the Dragon God's champion and High Marshal of the Shen Ce Fu, Yun Xiang did everything he could to preserve Cathay's safety. However, his actions were seen as overstepping by some of the Dragon's children, and his influence even drew the suspicion of "Jade Dragon" Yuan Bo.	true
loading_screen_quotes_description_wwd_quotes_jinjun04	When the Dragon Emperor first set foot upon the land now known as Cathay, it was roamed by countless indescribable beasts. Most perished during the Dragon Emperor's conquest to establish Cathay or faded with the passage of time. Yet they remain alive in Cathayan legend. Even today, people believe three guardian beasts still roam the wilds, protecting Cathay and upholding their ancient pact with the Dragon Emperor.	true
loading_screen_quotes_description_wwd_quotes_jinjun05	The Dragon's children quarrel incessantly, and the ambitions of provincial generals grow ever bolder. Some now whisper in secret that Cathay's former glory departed with the Dragon Emperor, and that even the mighty Great Bastion cannot prevent the empire's collapse from within.	true
loading_screen_quotes_description_wwd_quotes_jinjun06	"Mistrust between the Shen Ce Fu and the Dragon's children has grown uncontrollable. The Hongwu Inspector of the Inner Court and the Raven Spies of the Jade Court are stealing intelligence from each other. Yun Xiang openly declared to Yuan Bo that the Imperial Guard would only ever serve the Haotian Dragon. The generals across the land have their own plans. In Shang-Yang, the Garrison Bureau stands ready to act at your command. Should you raise the banner of rebellion, the Hongwu Inspectors will deliver messages to all provinces immediately, igniting uprisings across regions and prefectures. Before the Dragon's children return, the fate of the empire will already be sealed!"	true

loading_screen_quotes_description_wwd_quotes_jinjun07	Since the Dragon Emperor and the Moon Empress withdrew to focus on their grand plan, the Dragon's children have saved the empire from collapse countless times—only to bring it to the brink of destruction just as often. Most Cathayans enjoy stability and prosperity under their rule, a state that people of other nations can scarcely imagine. Yet only those caught in the fury of the Dragon's children know the deep scars these mighty beings have left upon Cathay.	true
loading_screen_quotes_description_wwd_quotes_jinjun08	In the year 2375 of the Imperial Calendar, three of the Dragon's children led their respective palace guards and large mortal armies into a brutal battle at Nian'an Monastery. Various factions attempted to mediate the conflict before it escalated, but all efforts failed. The Battle of Nian'an Monastery ended in mutual destruction. Less than one-tenth of the Imperial Guard survived, and the blood of the fallen stained the Jade River. The catastrophic losses shook the foundations of the Dragon's rule. Two years later, in 2377, the Monkey King seized control of Cathay.	true
loading_screen_quotes_description_wwd_quotes_jinjun09	Martial arts and chivalry hold an unshakable place of honor in Cathayan culture. However, the imperial authorities have rarely welcomed these "lone warriors" due to their chaotic and unpredictable nature compared to organized armies. Yet even they cannot deny that these selfless individuals have saved Cathay from countless crises.	true
loading_screen_quotes_description_wwd_quotes_jinjun10	Legends tell that the Dragon Emperor personally granted the Imperial Guard their extraordinary power centuries ago, making them unmatched in strength. But with the Dragon Emperor's departure, the Celestial Palace's guard cannot replenish its ranks. These last hundred or so Imperial Guardsmen are the final legacy of the Haotian Dragon's blessing. If they too were to fall, the name of the Imperial Guard would fade into another ephemeral myth of Cathay.	true
loading_screen_quotes_description_wwd_quotes_jinjun11	Fang Wenzi was the most powerful Celestial Chancellor in Cathay in centuries. Some say his mastery of elemental winds surpassed even some of the Dragon's children. During the End Times, Miao Ying the Storm Dragon shattered dozens of Chaos champions and their vast armies in the northern steppes, even establishing a foothold in the north. However, as Cathay's forces pursued their advantage, Qingbao Tianzun's plan unfolded: his followers revolted within the garrisoned cities, summoning several Greater Daemons and unleashing an endless Chaos horde from the wilderness. Miao Ying's army faced annihilation. At this critical moment, Fang Wenzi activated the Bridge to Heaven—a miracle beyond belief. Even an abandoned Bridge of Heaven, echoing with the remnants of the Haotian Dragon's power, typically requires hundreds of Celestial Chancellors working together to function. Perhaps the Dragon Emperor's gaze returned to the mortal realm, or perhaps this was his blessing all along. Miao Ying's army was transported back to the Great Bastion. As the last soldier vanished into the bridge, Fang Wenzi and his miracle faded into the wind, returning to the embrace of the earth.	true
loading_screen_quotes_description_wwd_quotes_jinjun12	The Battle of Xuan Yuan marked the first formal collaboration between Cathay's martial sects and the imperial government. Over a hundred sects formed a blood pact at the Wulin Assembly, stepping forward during the empire's most desperate hour to create a Great Bastion of flesh and blood at Xuan Yuan.	true
